Building
--------

The requirements for building the site are:

* [Bundler][]: run `gem install bundler`
* [Jekyll][]: run `gem install jekyll`
* gems listed in the Gemfile - though you can comment out parts you don't need
* [bibble][]: available on `pip`
* ssh and rsync, only if you want to deploy directly.

`make` compiles the bibliography and the website content to the `docs`
directory. To preview the site, run ``make serve`` and head to
http://localhost:4000.


Deploying to GitHub Pages
-----------------------

This template is optimized for hosting the site on GitHub Pages using a custom domain in `CNAME`. You can pick which branch you deploy the site on. A new commit/push to GitHub will trigger a rebuild.
